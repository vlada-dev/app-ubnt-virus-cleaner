# app-ubnt-virus-cleaner

This app helps with removing MF virus attacking some Ubiquiti devices with obsolete firmware version.

**Only the APK package is currently updated. Source code is now obsolete and I won't update it (I don't want to disclose virus removal procedure to virus authors).**


## How to start?

    * Enter IP addresses of your Ubiquiti devices with username and password (form "ip,username,password", one ip per line)
    * You can specify additional pair of login credentials. The app will try alternative login pairs if original login credentials fail. You can leave it empty.
    * If you want to run app in passive mode (no action), uncheck both checkboxes.
    * If you want to just remove virus without firmware upgrade, you can check only "Remove virus" checkbox
    * If you want to just remove virus and run firmware upgrade, check both checkboxes


##  Tested devices


    * Airmax M
    * App will probably work on Airmax AC, Airgateway, Airfiber, ToughSwitch models but it hasn't been tested yet.
